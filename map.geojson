    "description":"\"The Shahnama is a book of stories written for kings to teach lessons about life and was written by Firdowsi. It has been nicknamed the book of kings because the stories within it are supposed to teach young prince’s life lessons on how to become good and fair rulers. Most of the stories within revolve around kings and heroes of the Persian world. Firdowsi created the Shahnama because he was commissioned by king Shah Rusk to write a Shahnama for each of his three sons: Baysunghur, Ibrahim-Sultan, and Mauhammad Juki. Many other Shahnamas have also been created since, with each representing the cultural views and beliefs of that time, and they are a source of culture and identity, with owning a Shahnama being a sign of status in the Timurid period. Since the Shahnama was so immensely popular, its stories spread to many other places like India, the Ottoman empire, and Turkey, where the stories from the Shahnama were also celebrated and enjoyed. Showing how one culture can appreciate another's art and use it as a source of inspiration for their own works. The Shahnama inspired the creation of many other works of art and poems with similar focuses."},

    "description":"\"As we know there are many different versions of the Shahnama that have been made over time. The one we are looking at is Ibrhims Shahnama, commissioned by Ibrhims’s father king Shah Rusk as well as one for each of his brothers. Where they all cover the same stories, they each have their own focus shown in the differences in their illustrations and by what ones are shown. Ibrhims contains 47 of the 99 illustrations between his and his brother’s versions, which is almost half, Ibrhims version also out of him and his brothers is the one that had the most influence during its time in Timurid history. I would argue this could be because it had so many illustrations so even those who couldn’t read could flip through looking at the photos and understand the stories. Unfortunately, Ibrhims Shahnama is also the most damaged this is for many reasons; it has been taken apart with the photos removed from the physical manuscript, and much of it was painted with green paint from the Timurid era that contains copper carbonate that has burnt through the paper, as well as many of the scenes have been repainted to try and restore it which has altered their appearance. Ibrhims version has no illustrations of princely duties but instead has many depicting hunting, feasting, and battles, with 29 out of his 47 illustrations being related to these themes, and the majority of them show battels 20 of the 29. Ibrhims version also has a more limited and ton downed palette with lavender, pink, green, blue, and gray tones being popular throughout, compared to some of his brothers who used bold rich colors in their versions""},

Dry and his assistants, and the faithfulness and accuracy with which this work has been done an examination of the pages will attest. Absolute truth and accuracy in the representation of the territory has been the standard and in no cases have additions or alterations been made unless the same were actually in course of construction. In a few cases, important public and private edifices that are not yet finished are shown completed, and as they will appear when done. All the buildings within the limits of the survey in July, 1875, are shown; and a very large number of those executed or commenced since that date have been also introduced, the pages having been constantly corrected up to the last possible moment before publication.\""},
