    "description":"The Shahnama is a book of stories written for kings to teach lessons about life, written by Firdowsi. It has been nicknamed the book of kings because the stories within it are supposed to teach young princes life lessons on how to become good and fair rulers. Most of the stories within revolve around kings and heroes of the Persian world. Firdowsi created the Shahnama because he was commissioned by king Shah Rusk's three sons: Baysunghur, Ibrahim-Sultan, and Mauhammad Juki (Sims 1992, 43). Many other Shahnama have also been created since, with each representing the cultural views and beliefs of that time, and they are a source of culture and identity (Sims 1992, 43), with owning a Shahnama being a sign of status in the Timurid period (Simpson 2013). Since the Shahnama was so immensely popular, its stories spread to many other places like India, the Ottoman Empire, and Turkey (Simpson 2013), where the stories from the Shahnama were also celebrated and enjoyed. Showing how one culture can appreciate another's art and use it as a source of inspiration for their own works, the Shahnama inspired the creation of many other works of art and poems with similar focuses Simpson 2013).

    "description":"Mount Damavand is the mountain Zahhak is being nailed to in the image shown and often appears in many ancient legends and stories as a symbol of the Persian homeland (Hourcade and Tafazżżolī 2011). Mount Damavand is a real mountain in Iran that is the highest peak in Iran and is a volcano (Hourcade and Tafazżżolī 2011), showing how Firdowsi took inspiration from his surroundings. Zahhak's relationship with Mount Damavand isn't just interesting because it is where he is imprisoned by Faridun but also because he has a family connection to the mountain. If you look at Zahhak's family history, Zahhak's great-grandfather was Gayumars (Ahbabi 2016, 306), who also appears in the Shahnama as the first ruler of Iran (Hourcade and Tafazżżolī 2011), ruling from Mount Damavand. Gayumars was a very fair and just ruler who the people liked and respected. Zahhak's style of ruling is the complete opposite of Gayumars, where Zahhak's seen as an evil cannibal dictator Gayumars was liked and respected. If we compare the two styles of ruling and the two king's relationship with the mountain, we see quite a difference. Gayumars was a fair and respected ruler that ruled from the top of the mountain seen by everyone and was physically held above them. Compared to Zahhak who is imprisoned by the mountain, locked away inside to be forgotten. Today there is a local myth about Mount Damavand that the vapor that comes from it is Zahhaks breath, the noises are his groans, the lava his eyes, and the yellow water that comes from it is his urine (Hourcade and Tafazżżolī 2011). Revealing how the stories and legends of the past continue today."},

    "description":"Faridun is crucial in the story of Zahhak because he is the one who ends Zahhak's 1000 year reign of terror, and we need to know about Faridun's background to understand why he would want to join the rebellion against Zahhak. We first learn of Faridun when Zahhak has a nightmare of being dethroned, causing Zahhak to try and find and get rid of Faridun. Instead, Zahhak finds Faridun's father Abtin, a descendant of Jamshid the king Zahhak defeated to become king of the world (Ahbabi 2016,303). After Zahhak kills Faridun's father, Faridun's mother Faranak leaves him with the cow Birmaya because she has to flee from Zahhak. Birmaya then raises Faridun for three years before Faranak comes back for him since there was word spreading that Faridun was being taken care of by a cow. Soon after Faridun's mother comes back for him, Zahhak finds Birmaya and kills her to but Faridun safe with his mother and brothers. Years later, a blacksmith Kava is leading a rebellion against Zahhak for killing so many of the young people and who has killed almost all of his sons, Kava finds Faridun and convinces him to join the rebellion. Faridun joins the rebellion to overthrow Zahhak and avenge his father. When Faridun and Zahhak finally meet and battle Faridun defeats Zahhak but is convinced not to kill him and instead binds him to Mount Damavand so that he has to suffer until the end of the world. Faridun then takes the throne and rules for 500 years."},

    "description":"The devil is the one who corrupts Zahhak, yes Zahhak was the one to choose to kill his father with the help of the devil, but this is not what sealed Zahhaks fate to be remembered as an evil and tyrannical ruler. What sealed Zahhaks fate was the devil coming back disguised as a cook and kissing Zahhak on each shoulder, causing two snakes to grow out of Zahhaks shoulders, and then again disguised as a doctor who tells Zahhak the only way to get rid of the snakes is by having two human brains a day. Sealing Zahhak’s fate by having snakes growing from his shoulders, giving him the nickname the dragon king (Ahbabi 2016,302), and by engaging in cannibalism, killing his own subjects to feed his need. In this photo, we see Zahhak with the two snakes coming from his shoulders that look as though they are laughing and dancing, taking joy in Zahhaks pain. Since they are technically a part of the devil and are a symbol of the devil it is as though the devil is laughing at Zahhak, taking joy in his downfall. It seems Zahhak was always a puppet in the devil’s game, spending his whole life controlled by the devil leading to his downfall and now who he is stuck with until the end of time."},

    "description":"Since the Shahnama is so popular, many different versions have been created. With the Shahnama being so old, many were made at different times throughout history. Meaning different cultural views and beliefs affecting the way images look because they were created at different times, illustrated by other artists, or commissioned by people who wanted a different emphasis. As we see here, we have two images of Zahhak being bound to Mount Damavand. We have our image from Ibrahim Shahnama, and the other is from his brother Baysunghur, there are many similarities, and it is obvious they are depicting the same scene there are also many differences present. Showing how even Shahnamas made at similar times vary in how artists have depicted the images. The first thing I notice in Baysunghurs version is that Zahhak looks more disheveled with wild uncombed hair, his beard is long, and he is quite pale as if he hasn't seen the sun in years. While we know this image shows Zahhak when he is first bound to Mount Damavand through him being nailed in Baysunghur depiction of Zahhak gives you an image of what Zahhak might look like after years of being imprisoned. Ibrahim's version of Zahhak seems to be shown right at the time when he was bound, with both his beard and hair being quite short looking well-kept and blood still dripping from his hands."},
