    "description":"\"The Shahnama is a book of stories written for kings to teach lessons about life and was written by Firdowsi. It has been nicknamed the book of kings because the stories within it are supposed to teach young princeâ€™s life lessons on how to become good and fair rulers. Most of the stories within revolve around kings and heroes of the Persian world. Firdowsi created the Shahnama because he was commissioned by king Shah Rusk to write a Shahnama for each of his three sons: Baysunghur, Ibrahim-Sultan, and Mauhammad Juki. Many other Shahnamas have also been created since, with each representing the cultural views and beliefs of that time, and they are a source of culture and identity, with owning a Shahnama being a sign of status in the Timurid period. Since the Shahnama was so immensely popular, its stories spread to many other places like India, the Ottoman empire, and Turkey, where the stories from the Shahnama were also celebrated and enjoyed. Showing how one culture can appreciate another's art and use it as a source of inspiration for their own works. The Shahnama inspired the creation of many other works of art and poems with similar focuses."},

    "description":"\"The preliminary drawings for this work were made early in the spring of 1874. After a careful consideration of the subject, it was determined to locate the point of view so that the city would be seen from the southeast, believing that to be the most advantageous in all respects. Accordingly, the point of site was established on the Illinois side of the river, looking to the northwest, and at sufficient altitude to overlook the roofs of ordinary houses into the streets. A careful perspective, which required a surface of three hundred square feet, was then erected from a correct survey of the city, extending northward from Arsenal Island...\""},

Dry and his assistants, and the faithfulness and accuracy with which this work has been done an examination of the pages will attest. Absolute truth and accuracy in the representation of the territory has been the standard and in no cases have additions or alterations been made unless the same were actually in course of construction. In a few cases, important public and private edifices that are not yet finished are shown completed, and as they will appear when done. All the buildings within the limits of the survey in July, 1875, are shown; and a very large number of those executed or commenced since that date have been also introduced, the pages having been constantly corrected up to the last possible moment before publication.\""},
