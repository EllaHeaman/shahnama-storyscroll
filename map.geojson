    "description":"\"The Shahnama is a book of stories written for kings to teach lessons about life and was written by Firdowsi. It has been nicknamed the book of kings because the stories within it are supposed to teach young prince’s life lessons on how to become good and fair rulers. Most of the stories within revolve around kings and heroes of the Persian world. Firdowsi created the Shahnama because he was commissioned by king Shah Rusk to write a Shahnama for each of his three sons: Baysunghur, Ibrahim-Sultan, and Mauhammad Juki. Many other Shahnamas have also been created since, with each representing the cultural views and beliefs of that time, and they are a source of culture and identity, with owning a Shahnama being a sign of status in the Timurid period. Since the Shahnama was so immensely popular, its stories spread to many other places like India, the Ottoman empire, and Turkey, where the stories from the Shahnama were also celebrated and enjoyed. Showing how one culture can appreciate another's art and use it as a source of inspiration for their own works. The Shahnama inspired the creation of many other works of art and poems with similar focuses."},

    "description":"\"As we know there are many different versions of the Shahnama that have been made over time. The one we are looking at is Ibrhims Shahnama, commissioned by Ibrhims’s father king Shah Rusk as well as one for each of his brothers. Where they all cover the same stories, they each have their own focus shown in the differences in their illustrations and by what ones are shown. Ibrhims contains 47 of the 99 illustrations between his and his brother’s versions, which is almost half, Ibrhims version also out of him and his brothers is the one that had the most influence during its time in Timurid history. I would argue this could be because it had so many illustrations so even those who couldn’t read could flip through looking at the photos and understand the stories. Unfortunately, Ibrhims Shahnama is also the most damaged this is for many reasons; it has been taken apart with the photos removed from the physical manuscript, and much of it was painted with green paint from the Timurid era that contains copper carbonate that has burnt through the paper, as well as many of the scenes have been repainted to try and restore it which has altered their appearance. Ibrhims version has no illustrations of princely duties but instead has many depicting hunting, feasting, and battles, with 29 out of his 47 illustrations being related to these themes, and the majority of them show battels 20 of the 29. Ibrhims version also has a more limited and ton downed palette with lavender, pink, green, blue, and gray tones being popular throughout, compared to some of his brothers who used bold rich colors in their versions"},

    "description":"Zahhak was the king of the world for 1000 years, becoming king by making a deal with the devil to kill his father. Once Zahhak is king, the devil disguises himself as a cook and kisses Zahhak on each of his shoulders, causing a snake to grow out of each of Zahhaks shoulders. The devil then disguises himself again as a doctor, telling Zahhak the only way to keep the snakes at bay is by having two human brains a day from young men. After many years in power, Zahhak has a dream where he is overthrown, prompting him to go to fortune tellers to ask them to find out the truth and his fate. It is then Zahhak learns of Faridun who is prophesied to dethrone him. Eventually, Faridun joins a revolution started by Kava whose sons Zahhak had almost all killed for their brains. Faridun goes to overthrow Zahhak, but when he arrives Zahhak is nowhere to be found. Faridun takes the throne and breaks the dark spells Zahhak had placed. Kundrav then brings news of the events to Zahhak, prompting him to set out to battle Faridun. When Zahhak arrives, he tries sneaking up on Faridun, but when he sees Faridun with one of his wives Zahhak becomes so jealous that he gives away his cover. As soon as he does Faridun attacks Zahhak tying him up with his own lasso. Zahhak is then taken on the back of a camel to mount Damavand where he is bound to the mountain so that his pain will endure, and he will suffer. “He bore Zahhak as one that rideth post and fettered him upon Mount Dainawand; So, when new bonds were added to the old, And fate had not another ill in store, The glory of Zahhak became like dust And earth was cleansed from his abominations, He was removed from kindred and from friends, And bonds alone were left him in the mountains” (169) by Warner. G and Waner. E. Faridun then goes on to be crowned king while Zahhak is imprisoned until the end of the world."},

    "description":"Mount Damavand is the mountain Zahhak is being nailed to in the image shown and often appears in many ancient legends and stories as a symbol of the Persian homeland. Mount Damavand is a real mountain in Iran that is the highest peak in Iran and is a volcano, showing how Firdowsi took inspiration from his surroundings. Zahhak's relationship with Mount Damavand isn't just interesting because it is where he is imprisoned by Faridun but also because he has a family connection to the mountain. If you look at Zahhak's family history, Zahhak's great-grandfather was Gayumars, who also appears in the Shahnama as the first ruler of Iran, ruling from Mount Damavand. Gayumars was a very fair and just ruler who the people liked and respected and it is said that he brought the arts of life to the culture, such as food and dress. When we compare this style of ruling to Zahhak's it is the complete opposite, where Zahhak was seen as evil, Gayumars was liked and respected. If we compare the two styles of ruling and the two king's relationship with the mountain, we see quite a difference. Gayumars was a fair and respected ruler that ruled from the top of the mountain seen by everyone and physically held above them. Compared to Zahhak who is imprisoned by the mountain, locked away inside to be forgotten. Today there is a local myth about Mount Damavand that the vapor that comes from it is Zahhaks breath, the noises his groans, the lava his eyes, and the yellow water that comes from it his urine, showing how the stories and legends continue into today."},

    "description":"Faridun is crucial in the story of Zahhak because he is the one who ends Zahhak's 1000 year reign of terror, and we need to know about Faridun's background to understand why he would want to join the rebellion against Zahhak. We first learn of Faridun when Zahhak has a nightmare of being dethroned, causing Zahhak to try and find and get rid of Faridun. Instead, Zahhak finds Faridun's father Abtin, a descendant of Jamshid the king Zahhak defeated to become king of the world. After Zahhak kills Faridun's father, Faridun's mother Faranak leaves him with the cow Birmaya because she has to flee from Zahhak. Birmaya then raises Faridun for three years before Faranak comes back for him since there was word spreading that Faridun was being taken care of by a cow. Soon after Faridun's mother comes back for him, Zahhak finds Birmaya and kills her to but Faridun safe with his mother and brothers. Years later, a blacksmith Kava is leading a rebellion against Zahhak for killing so many of the young people and who has killed almost all of his sons, Kava finds Faridun and convinces him to join the rebellion. Faridun joins the rebellion to overthrow Zahhak and avenge his father. When Faridun and Zahhak finally meet and battle Faridun defeats Zahhak but is convinced not to kill him and instead binds him to Mount Damavand so that he has to suffer until the end of the world. Faridun then takes the throne and rules for 500 years."},
